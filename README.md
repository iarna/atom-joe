# Wordstar/Joe Style Editing

Adds wordstar-style keybindings a'la the command line editor *joe*,
including persistent block manipulation, separate from selection.

This aims to be a complete `joe` mode for Atom. Because I'd rather write
code than learn new keybindings. ðŸ˜‰Plus, I'm too used to being able to mark
a block of text and operate on it without having it go away any time I move
the cursor.

## Known Bugs

If you move a block and then undo the move, the display of your buffer will
be corrupted.
